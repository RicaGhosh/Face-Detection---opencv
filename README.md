# FaceDetection using OpenCV

This project utilizes OpenCV Library to make a Real-Time Face Detection using the webcam as a primary camera. 

## OpenCV 

OpenCV is a video and image processing library built on Python programming language and it is used for image and video analysis, like facial detection, license plate reading, photo editing, advanced robotic vision, and many more.

## Haar Cascade Frontal-Face classifiers

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Here, we will be using the face classifier.
